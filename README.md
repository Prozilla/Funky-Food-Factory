## How to play

### Download

1. Go [here](https://github.com/Prozilla/Funky-Factories/tree/main/builds) and download the latest version as an executable jar file.
2. If you don't already have a JDK, go to [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and click download on the latest version.
3. Finally, simple open the jar file and the game should launch in a new window (note that this window is currently unable to be resized or changed to fullscreen mode).

If you're using a mac you'll likely get an error message saying "The Java Jar file "FunkyFactories.jar" could not be launched". If this happens, open a terminal using `command` + `space bar` and type "terminal", then press enter to open the terminal and type `java -jar \path\to\FunkyFactories.jar` inside the terminal (replace the last part of the command with the directory to your jar file).

### Controls

- LMB: place building
- MMB: move camera
